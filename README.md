Hello, world!
Hello, GitHub!

I'm Joey. Probably a programmer in the near future.
Programming seems a lot of fun to me, though I'm struggling much learning to code.
Maybe I wasn't born so clever, and programming is kind of hard, still, how amazing what a computer can do!
It's mind-blowing to learn to be a programmer. It brings me into a whole new world and even changes the way I think.

Thank you for learning about me.
